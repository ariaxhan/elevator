# elevator

I made different classes for passengers, floors, elevators, building, simulation, time, variables, and main. 

I used a separate class called variables to store all of the variables in the properties file to make sure that the variables could be used across the classes. I used the time class to calculate, measure, and print out the times.

 I used ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot to help me with my project. 

 I used lists for everything except for the floor queues. For the floors I made two queues, one going up and one going down. The passengers are added to the correct queue for their floor when they are generated.
